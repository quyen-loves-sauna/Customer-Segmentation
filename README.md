# Customer-Segmentation
X company manufactures orthopedic devices and sells them worldwide. The company sells directly to individual doctors who use them on rehabilitation and physical therapy patients. Historically, the sales and customer support departments have grouped doctors by geography. However, the region is not a good predictor of the number of purchases a doctor will make or their support needs. We want to use a data-centric approach to segmenting doctors to improve marketing, customer service, and product planning. Our main goal throughout this analysis is composed of three objectives:  
- The number of doctors and their average number of purchases per region 
- The relationship between purchases and complaints  - 
- New customer segmentation
